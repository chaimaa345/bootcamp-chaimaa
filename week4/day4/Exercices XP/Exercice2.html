<!--   What happens when you click "Send"?
The data is sent to the server in the body of the HTTP request, not in the URL.

The browser’s URL does NOT show the data (unlike with GET).  

Where can you see the data?
 In the Network tab of your browser dev tools
Open Developer Tools (usually F12 or right-click → Inspect → Network tab).
 Click "Send" on your form.
You will see a new network request (it might say "document" or show your file name).
Click on that request.
Look at the Headers or Payload section:

You will see something like: name=chaimaa&comments=beautiful+view       -->
